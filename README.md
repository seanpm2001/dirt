# What is "dirt"?
A first-person, turn-based adventure game written in Pygame.

## Dependencies
This game just depends on Python and Pygame.
I test the game with these specific versions:

* Python 3.5.3
* Pygame 1.9.3

## Running
Just execute dirt.py using your Python interpreter
(and make sure Pygame is installed)!
